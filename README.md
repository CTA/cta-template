CTA Rails Application Template
============
This template is only tested and verified with Rails 3.2.\*

Simple template for customizing the rails environment

Here's how you use this template when creating a new rails app:

  `rails new myapp -m https://raw.github.com/CTA/cta-template/master/cta-template.rb`

If for some reason this doesn't work you can download the file and run:

  `rails new myapp -m cta-template.rb`

List of modifications to a regular rails app:
  * Changes the database.yml to postgres defaults and creates a database.yml.example.
  * Adds a .gitignore with more common files.
  * Adds test environment generator lines to config/application.rb.
  * Adds custom spec\_helper.rb file with spork methods.
  * Installs Rspec instead of Test::Unit.
  * Sets up guard and spork to run off the bat.
  * Converts application.html.erb to application.html.haml.
  * Sets up gemfile with some common gems.

Also I have provided a sample\_app that was generated through this template.
